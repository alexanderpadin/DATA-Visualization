There are four other vendors with thrusters on the market that use AF-M315E, none have been flight qualified yet. Additionally, any new propellant or chemical requries a commercial manufacturing supplier.  AFRL is currently the only supplier of AF-M315E and is seeking a commercial supplier to take over manufacturing the product and is also engaging the AFRL MANTECH office to assist in this endeavor.  Finally, there are a number of other hurdles that must be overcome such as getting the launch sites to see AF-M315E as totally different than Hydrazine and changing how they process and operate with the material.  AFRL held a workshop at the 2015 JANNAF meeting to identify the remaining hurdles and how to go about overcoming them to truly commercialize AF-M315E.  AFRL is moving on to develop bipropellants using Ionic Liquids to replace current NTO\/MMH used on several systems.  These new propellants will require the same level of maturation activities as were conducted to mature AF-M315E and will take about 15-20 years to reach TRL 6.","status":"Updated","rationale_for_change":"","smi":"","tn_poc":"Hampsten, Ken","org":"SMC\/ ADYI","phone":"DSN 633-9322","tn_email":"kenneth.hampsten@us.af.mil","cmd_lead_poc":"Lush, George, Lt Col","cl_org":"A8XP","cl_email":"george.lush@us.af.mil","cl_phone":"DSN 692-3197","year_entered":"2008","2012CFMPdeltas":"","first_entered_guidance":"Rd10 -Nov 2008","orig_deriv":"\r"}, {"index":"86","need_focus":"AFRL, Industry, et al","capability_area":"P - Space Electronics","system_or_concept":"Space Electronics","cap_priority":"14","team_priority":"1","block-spirals":"","tn_title":"Next Generation Reprogrammable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  ","tn_id":"737","tnd":"continuing need; 2020 technology checkpoint","tnd_year":"2020","impact":"High","assessment":"","target_perf_goals":"Continuous improvement; requires availability from a trusted source. 2020 goal to have devices with speed and density in the Virtex 5 to Virtex 7 range","trl_req_at_tnd":"6","need_class":"2","req_basis_src":"Pervasive technology generally applicable across multiple capability areas","description_benefit":"Problem Description:   Continuing improvement in rad-hard reprogrammable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).

Most future SMC satellite subsystem designs envision the use of high-density FPGAs.\r\rAn FPGA is a chip designed with many possibilities for logic functions and registers and routing between them.  It is prefabricated and provided to a user to \"complete\" the design _ customizing it to the user's functional needs.  Like ASICs, FPGAs can be customized to perform any type of digital processing.  As the final customization of an FPGA is done by the user, the cost and schedule delay of producing an equivalent ASIC can mostly be saved.  Reprogrammable FPGAs can be customized many times _ helpful if design flaws are discovered _ and can even be reprogrammed on orbit.  Unless certain steps are taken, however, the configuration can be changed by SEEs or even sabotage.  Compared to ASICs, FPGAs tend to be slower, larger, consume more power, and are limited to particular die sizes offered.  However, these problems are largely masked because at any point in time FPGAs will be available at more advanced technology nodes than a custom ASIC capability.  RH reprogrammable FPGA offerings are currently sparse, and not available from trusted sources.\r\rBenefit:   Achieve high functional performance (density and speed) while avoiding the cost, schedule, and development complexity of custom ASICs.

In developing space qualified counterparts to these commercial developments, the program focuses on a balanced mixture of performance, reduced power, and high reliability (including radiation hardness) in the space environment. For radiation hardness, NGSE primarily uses Radiation Hardening by Design (RHBD) techniques pioneered at RVSE, which allows the program to work with advanced foundries and access the cost and performance benefits of commercial microelectronics technology.","initial_trl":"3","investment_portfolio":"Technology Base\/Technologies\/Space Electronics Technology","invportfolio_top":"Technology Base","lead_td":"RV","program_name":"Space Electronics Technology","real_ctc":"Space Electronics","real_subctc":"Components","start_date":"4\/7\/06","distro_id":"D","td_id":"RV","ctc_id":"404","subctc_id":"46"}, {"clarity_unique_id":"PPM00000956","ctcname":"Structural Materials and Applications","ctc_sub":"CMCs","current_trl":"3","distribution_code":"C US Government Agencies and their Contractors only","distroletter":"C","end_date":"9\/30\/19","exclude":"No","final_trl":"4","general_description_long":"The overall objective of the Program is to develop, validate at the subscale level, and predict the behavior and life of silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced, silicon-carbide-matrix ceramic matrix composites (SiC\/SiC CMC) that meet the performance requirements of components in the hot section of advanced turbine engines to CMC temperature of 2700\u00a1F.

The Trust and Influence program is motivated by recent technological advances in the area of unmanned and autonomous systems, and the strategic environment that the U.S. Air Force is expected to face in the future; a significant departure from that which has dominated most of its history. The Air Force is facing a broader range of threats that are less predictable, with many conflicts occurring in failed or failing states that include radical extremists and a wide range of non-state actors. Moreover, the rapid advances and proliferation of advanced autonomous systems are expected to fundamentally change the way the Air Force operates. To address these challenges, the Trust and Influence program invests in the development of the theoretical and empirical foundations of reliance and contemporary influence. Specifically, we are concerned with investigating the mechanisms by which humans establish, maintain, and repair trust in other agents, both human and machine. The science of influence or persuasion will expand our understanding for how we might shape the behaviors, attitudes and beliefs of others. The resulting portfolio directly enhances the Air Force's technology development programs, and will impact policies and operations related to national security. Trust and Influence invests in the discovery of the foundational concepts of effective influence, deterrence, trust-building, trust calibration, and counter-terrorism operations. Multi-disciplinary approaches are encouraged, to include cognitive science, neuroscience, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, economics, computer science and mathematics. Research designs that incorporate laboratory studies, modeling or field research leading to transformative novel theories are also encouraged.

The primary goal of this program with respect to deep space imaging is to demonstrate the capability to discriminate between closely spaced objects (CSO) in Geo orbits. NGAS\u00d5s three key technologies used are a 3.5m telescope, adaptive optics (AO) and a sodium guidestar.  \u00a6  The second major focus of CEUAO is R&D for timely and available SSA. CEUAO is funding projects to demonstrate high resolution LEO (Low Earth Orbit) imagery 24\/7. 24\/7 imagery includes three specific types of imagery: daylight, terminator, and full-dark. Full-dark imaging was demonstrated in 2008, but more work needs to be done in refining this capability to meet its TPMs (i.e. 40cm resolution). The key technologies for full-dark imaging are a tracking laser, imaging laser, sodium guidestar, AO, and 3.5m telescope. In the past year,  research developments in the NGAS project have consistently demonstrated remarkable improvements in the ability to demonstrate passive and active terminator imaging up to ~20cm resolution in LEO.

A mature process involving experiment, modeling and probabilistic assessments is conducted to achieve these objectives.  First, targets of interest are assessed for aim point selection corresponding to failure mode potential.  In preparation for conducting a vulnerability assessment, material properties are obtained or measured along with system-level detail and potential for secondary damage effects.  Statistical methods are then applied to assess probability of effect bounded by confidence intervals.  Simultaneously with this, state-of-the-art laboratories and field testing employing innovative diagnostic techniques are used to measure and irradiate targets and components in a realistic manner representative of laser weapon engagements.  A synergistic combination of experimental and modeling approaches can then be used to address the full range of interaction trade space possibilities.  Laser vulnerability experiments advance the understanding of the phenomenology of laser interaction to find new effects that could result in laser lethality enhancement for defeating targets.  The data is also used for validating model prediction uncertainty so that application of the model can be applied in a credible manner to support the development of target vulnerability assessment predictions for relevant targets.","initial_trl":"2","investment_portfolio":"Technology Base\/Science and Knowledge\/Laser Effects, Modeling & Simulation","invportfolio_top":"Technology Base","lead_td":"RD","program_name":"Laser Vulnerability Research","real_ctc":"Laser Systems (LS)","real_subctc":"#N\/A","start_date":"10\/1\/06","distro_id":"D","td_id":"RD","ctc_id":"380","subctc_id":null}, {"clarity_unique_id":"PPM00004109","ctcname":"Structural Materials and Applications","ctc_sub":"OMCs","current_trl":"3","distribution_code":"D DoD and DoD Contractors only","distroletter":"D","end_date":"3\/10\/19","exclude":"No","final_trl":"6","general_description_long":"The goal of this Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) composite material Foundational Engineering Problem (FEP) program is to demonstrate the ICME methodology of linking material processing, property, structure relationships for material design to account for processibility, manufacturability, system performance and sustainability.

The purpose of this research team is to explore and expand frontier methods enhancing the fidelity and the reducing empiricism associated with predicting and representing materials performance.  Particular focus is given to methods that lead to a probabilistic prediction of material performance for engineered hardware that ties to material structure (both microstructure and defect structure) or heterogeneity and its evolution.","initial_trl":"3","investment_portfolio":"Technology Base\/Technologies\/Technology Base Technologies","invportfolio_top":"Technology Base","lead_td":"RX","program_name":"Efficient Propulsion Initiative","real_ctc":"Structural Materials and Applications","real_subctc":"CMCs","start_date":"8\/15\/16","distro_id":"D","td_id":"RX","ctc_id":"417","subctc_id":"79"}, {"clarity_unique_id":"PPM00009820","ctcname":"Connectivity and Dissemination","ctc_sub":"Tactical Information Management & Networking","current_trl":"4","distribution_code":"C US Government Agencies and their Contractors only","distroletter":"C","end_date":"9\/30\/18","exclude":"No","final_trl":"6","general_description_long":"Develop and demonstrate seamless information discovery and delivery through dynamically federated information spaces that span the globe across heterogeneous networks ranging from from forward-deployed tactical datalink wireless networks to enterprise level LANs\/WANs.","initial_trl":"4","investment_portfolio":"Capabilities\/Concepts\/Tactical IM & Networking Capability","invportfolio_top":"Capabilities","lead_td":"RI","program_name":"Global Operational Tactical Information Technology","real_ctc":"Connectivity and Dissemination","real_subctc":"#N\/A","start_date":"7\/1\/14","distro_id":"C","td_id":"RI","ctc_id":"395","subctc_id":null}, {"clarity_unique_id":"PPM00009888","ctcname":"Cyber Science & Technology","ctc_sub":"Foundations of Trusted Systems","current_trl":"4","distribution_code":"C US Government Agencies and their Contractors only","distroletter":"C","end_date":"9\/30\/17","exclude":"No","final_trl":"6","general_description_long":"Design, develop and demonstrate foundations for trustworthy computing systems.

SSLT also receives customer funding from AFNWC and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to develop an Advanced Inertial Measurement Unit (AIMU) and improved site security for National Sites respectively.  Additionally, SSLT has received external funds for investing in developing in-house testing and research capabilities.  There is also overlap with GN&C in the Space Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) area.   SSLT is also actively supporting and monitoring the Cold Atom Interferometry work in RVBYM.\rA natural progression of the component development is the incorporation of the SRBA and SFOG into the AIMU.  A development schedule and cost projection is included in this execution plan for an IMU referred to as the Advanced IMU (AIMU).\rThe SSLT requirements are derived from USSTRATCOM, AFGSC S&T Guidance, and Congressional direction that calls for components with the following characteristics and attributes:\r\r\u00a5\tRegain Peacekeeper accuracy\r\u00a5\tHigher Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)\r\u00a5\tLower cost\r\u00a5\tReduce size, weight, and power with increased robustness\r\u00a5\tEnable guidance set R&R without missile destack\r\u00a5\tNavy commonality\r\u00a5\tIncreased target set\r\u00a5\tImproved Security","initial_trl":"3","investment_portfolio":"Technology Base\/Technologies\/Stragetic Systems and Launch Technology","invportfolio_top":"Technology Base","lead_td":"RV","program_name":"Strategic Systems & Launch Tech","real_ctc":"Space Platforms","real_subctc":"GN&C and Autonomy","start_date":"10\/15\/03","distro_id":"D","td_id":"RV","ctc_id":"407","subctc_id":"52"}, {"clarity_unique_id":"PPM00010934","ctcname":"Processing and Exploitation","ctc_sub":"Automated Exploitation","current_trl":"4","distribution_code":"C US Government Agencies and their Contractors only","distroletter":"C","end_date":"3\/31\/21","exclude":"No","final_trl":"6","general_description_long":"The goal of Electronics Exploitation program is to detect, locate and ID signals in the RF spectrum that are emitted by enemy weapons systems.

Missions requiring higher power such as solar electric propulsion will be enabled. Flexible cells allow for rolled stowage options, which can grant an immediate payload weight savings. Lower mass cells may allow for a dual or step down launch vehicle, which can grant millions of dollars in savings.\rThe customers supported by this program ( primarily NASA, SMC, and OGA) are all represented on the joint government team.

It is also the intent of this need to provide a method of assessing new energy storage technology at BOL through EOL.  \r\rLi-ion transition can be facilitated by broader use of ground and on-orbit data, in depth understanding of current modeling architectures and a second look at the limitations of accelerated testing.  Solution framework for life determination includes:  \r1) Extrapolation of low cycle on-orbit data to long life application.  Embedded in this argument is the ability to analytically define the relatively short life on-orbit behavior and correlate to measured data and ground life test.  Life estimation parameters will then be used to determine behavior and uncertainty for other operational environments and operating conditions.\r2) Define cyclic performance in terms of electrochemical transport and kinetics.  Assess ability of analytic model(s) to make accurate performance prediction using short term data.  Identify model limitations with respect to propagation of side reactions, the rate at which principle chemical contributors to degradation occur and impact on electric performance.  \r3) Evaluate methods by which accelerated life data may be acquired for new li-ion chemistry.  Determine the electric, life performance deviation by introducing new cell constituents (changes to electrode, electrolyte and separators)\r\rBenefit:    Current state of practice is 50 to 55 W-hr.\/kg.  Higher specific energy provides additional payload capability, improves mass margin and increases potential for cost effective manifest.                                      \r\r","priority":"14","impact":"M","attribute_id":null,"gap_id":"386","tnd":"2015-06-15","trl":"4"}, {"id":"271","title":"Develop technology that supports lower mass, smaller volume and lower power consumption for space vehicles","description":"Problem Description:    Technologies to reduce size, weight and power will enable smaller space vehicles with similar capability to current systems.

The significance of solar array mass is recognized, but for existing launch vehicles has secondary importance.  Mass may become a design driver for some spacecraft configurations.  Consideration is also given to on-orbit degradation such that end of life power capability doesn\u00cdt diminish total mission value.  For example higher efficiency may demand incorporation of additional junctions with increased radiation and temperature sensitivity such that EOL performance is less than SOP.  Since degradation environment and mission life can be highly variable tracking efficiency from BOL to EOL is critical for assessing performance.  Further, high solar cell cost is a concern that must be weighed against improved electric performance, operating temperature and radiation hardness.
