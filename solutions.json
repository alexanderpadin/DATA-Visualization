NGSE is the government\u00d5s most significant investment in space microelectronic components, and has the best technology transition record in AFRL into operational programs. \rThe NGSE program leverages the trillion-dollar commercial investment in microelectronic fabrication processes down to the 32-nanometer node and in data processing components and systems that have revolutionized every aspect of modern life in the last 40 years.  This leverage has the potential to enable multiple-order-of-magnitude leaps in capability and affordability for operational systems and in the capability of the warfighter. \rNGSE\u00d5s challenge is to translate from the commercial environment (very high volumes, focus on cost and performance over reliability, no radiation effects) to a space-appropriate environment (very low volumes; size, weight and power (SWAP) focus; high reliability; radiation effects) without losing too much performance or affordability. In developing space qualified counterparts to these commercial developments, the program focuses on a balanced mixture of performance, reduced power, and high reliability (including radiation hardness) in the space environment. For radiation hardness, NGSE primarily uses Radiation Hardening by Design (RHBD) techniques pioneered at RVSE, which allows the program to work with advanced foundries and access the cost and performance benefits of commercial microelectronics technology.",

The Trust and Influence program is motivated by recent technological advances in the area of unmanned and autonomous systems, and the strategic environment that the U.S. Air Force is expected to face in the future; a significant departure from that which has dominated most of its history. The Air Force is facing a broader range of threats that are less predictable, with many conflicts occurring in failed or failing states that include radical extremists and a wide range of non-state actors. Moreover, the rapid advances and proliferation of advanced autonomous systems are expected to fundamentally change the way the Air Force operates. To address these challenges, the Trust and Influence program invests in the development of the theoretical and empirical foundations of reliance and contemporary influence. Specifically, we are concerned with investigating the mechanisms by which humans establish, maintain, and repair trust in other agents, both human and machine. The science of influence or persuasion will expand our understanding for how we might shape the behaviors, attitudes and beliefs of others. The resulting portfolio directly enhances the Air Force's technology development programs, and will impact policies and operations related to national security. Trust and Influence invests in the discovery of the foundational concepts of effective influence, deterrence, trust-building, trust calibration, and counter-terrorism operations. Multi-disciplinary approaches are encouraged, to include cognitive science, neuroscience, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, economics, computer science and mathematics. Research designs that incorporate laboratory studies, modeling or field research leading to transformative novel theories are also encouraged. See p. 29 of AFOSR BAA 2015-0001 for details.",

To meet the needs (top AFSPC S&T needs, and STRATCOM SSA ICD gaps) in deep space imaging CEUAO is supporting a project called NGAS (sodium guidestar adaptive optics for SSA). The primary goal of this program with respect to deep space imaging is to demonstrate the capability to discriminate between closely spaced objects (CSO) in Geo orbits. NGAS\u00d5s three key technologies used are a 3.5m telescope, adaptive optics (AO) and a sodium guidestar.  \u00a6  The second major focus of CEUAO is R&D for timely and available SSA. CEUAO is funding projects to demonstrate high resolution LEO (Low Earth Orbit) imagery 24\/7. 24\/7 imagery includes three specific types of imagery: daylight, terminator, and full-dark. Full-dark imaging was demonstrated in 2008, but more work needs to be done in refining this capability to meet its TPMs (i.e. 40cm resolution). The key technologies for full-dark imaging are a tracking laser, imaging laser, sodium guidestar, AO, and 3.5m telescope. In the past year,  research developments in the NGAS project have consistently demonstrated remarkable improvements in the ability to demonstrate passive and active terminator imaging up to ~20cm resolution in LEO. Finally, starting towards the end of 2013 CEUAO will begin to address daylight imaging. Daytime imaging R&D results from Maui (AFRL\/RDSM) will be used to expedite daytime imaging R&D at the Starfire Optical Range (AFRL\/RDS). CEUAO\u00d5s goal with daytime imaging is to provide hi-res LEO images and CSO detection for Geos in 2017.",

Damage protection of \u00d2current\u00d3 SWIR sensors will vary depending on the type, thickness and location of the substrate, active layers along with their material properties and the sensor\u00d5s electrical architecture.  Preliminary tests have shown that some standard SWIR sensors are inherently hardened against damage due to a coincidental choice in the sensor substrate material used.  However, it has yet to be determined whether this is the sole factor or just a contributor.  Damage protection of \u00d2next generation\u00d3 SWIR sensors will require more evaluation and creative material substitution when it comes to mitigation techniques.  This is because as the sensor bandwidth is extended into the visible region some sensors lose their inherent protection capability.\rProtection options would consist of a combination of passive\/active photon control, adaptive imaging algorithms, and\/or electron control within the sensor itself.  While each strategy is viable, considerable work is required to develop novel materials, image processing techniques and\/or sensor electronics redesign.

DoD is interested in deploying Directed Energy (DE) systems -- which employ adaptive optics (AO) subsystems -- across the battlespace.  However, using current technology, system performance is significantly degraded in large segments of the battlespace.  The reason is that current AO technologies were designed for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) applications, specifically imaging of satellites.  In SSA, AO dramatically improves performance if the propagation path through the \u00d2turbulent\u00d3 atmosphere is \u00d2short\u00d3 and conditions are changing \u00d2slowly\u00d3.  (Best performance: high altitude observatories looking straight up with no slewing or wind)  Due to adaptive optics revolutionary success in this regime, DoD is interested in attaining similar advances in other mission areas, for instance laser beam power projection on tactical aircraft.  However, outside the original SSA design conditions, the technology is pushed into new regimes with longer propagation paths through turbulence and rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. (Near horizontal propagation, low elevation angle SSA imaging, systems on airborne platforms, rapidly slewing of telescopes)  These new regimes change the fundamental nature of the disturbance which, in many applications, degrades AO performance to unacceptable levels.",

In preparation for conducting a vulnerability assessment, material properties are obtained or measured along with system-level detail and potential for secondary damage effects.  Statistical methods are then applied to assess probability of effect bounded by confidence intervals.  Simultaneously with this, state-of-the-art laboratories and field testing employing innovative diagnostic techniques are used to measure and irradiate targets and components in a realistic manner representative of laser weapon engagements.  A synergistic combination of experimental and modeling approaches can then be used to address the full range of interaction trade space possibilities.  Laser vulnerability experiments advance the understanding of the phenomenology of laser interaction to find new effects that could result in laser lethality enhancement for defeating targets.

DSX is a key element of the Radiation Belt Remediation program, an AFRL program to determine the feasibility of fielding ground- and\/or space-based systems to protect critical space assets in times of crisis. DSX will feature a high-power very-low-frequency (VLF) transmitter and two receivers to determine the injection efficiency and global propagation of VLF electromagnetic waves into the magnetosphere from the spacecraft as well as from ground-based sources. DSX is instrumented to observe interaction of these VLF waves with orbiting radiation particles and their resulting precipitation from orbit. DSX spectrometers will measure populations of orbiting radiation particles across multiple orders of magnitude in a 6,000 km x 12,000 km orbit, and also determine the MEO environment\u00d5s effect on advanced electronics, optical coatings, and materials.

The context for all such investigations is the scramjet engine flow path in either a rectangular or an axi-symmetric configuration.  Shock-boundary layer interactions are important throughout the scramjet flowpath where boundary layer separation dramatically affects engine performance and stability, as well as changes the local heat flux to the structure.  Fuel-air mixing is critical to high combustion efficiency and can vary substantially with different modes of engine operation driven by the changing flight speed.  Ignition, stability, and combustion performance are affected by kinetic rates ; designing to appropriate rates is a challenge exacerbated by the complexity of the hydrocarbon fuels of interest to the Air Force.  Multi-phase flows are relevant to the scramjet due to the varying heat flux to the engine structure and the attendant impact on the coolant (the fuel) temperature.  The scramjet operation is very dynamic with few adjustment parameters to maintain stable propulsion.  Computational Fluid Dynamics will be a highly utilized and crucial tool for solving the fundamental problems stated above.\"",

Across the DOD, HECOE has developed the most comprehensive and rigorous bioeffects Systems Engineering Architecture to enable DOD NLW and thus defines the state-of-the art. HECOE employs the SE distinction between structure and process. For structure, HECOE addresses three Jointly-vetted dimensions 1) Novel Technologies 2) Operational Outcomes and 3) Bioeffects R&D and models (both physiological and psychological). Bioeffects are the causal link between Novel Technologies and Operational Outcomes. For process, HECOE employs 1) an Experimental Guidebook that contains standardized research designs (basic, applied, field, and simulations) 2) predictive models (categorical, statistical, and computational) and 3) methods for subject matter expert (SME) validation. There are significant technical challenges involved in 1) developing research protocols 2) executing field research on behavioral effects 3) overseeing research protocols on animals, humans, and cadavers 4) overseeing development of computational models of physiological effects of light, heat, sound, and blast. There are also technical challenges involved in maintaining currency of the dimensions of Novel Technologies and Operational Outcomes, which requires extensive knowledge of emerging technologies and shifting operational requirements. HECOE does not have a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) per se, rather it is a scientific program and SE architecture for advancing the TRL of all NLW bioeffects R&D to 6 or 7, and to ensure that those efforts are aligned with current operational requirements.",

A primary long term goal is to gain better understanding of travelling ionospheric disturbances since these waves are known to be a limiting factor on OTHR accuracy and precision. High-fidelity simulations of the radar system, to include ionospheric effects, scintillations and high frequency (HF) ray tracing of the radar coverage area and target parameters, are under development.

AFRL\/RV has been developing 33-35% high efficiency solar cells under an ATD for the last several years. Now that several thousand prototype cells have been built and tested under development programs it is time to transition from R&D to production. AFRL ManTech involvement at the early stages of this transition will greatly reduce the manufacturing and cost risks. \rThe objective of this program is to improve manufacturing capabilities, develop improved manufacturing processes, and space qualify AM0, one-sun, inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cells. Productization and qualification of high efficiency, flexible IMM space solar cells will improve critical performance and volume budgets for warfighter-specific satellite payloads.  AF ManTech is supporting the space industrial base by enabling the cost effective, domestic production of space solar cells, which are on the Critical Technologies List. High efficiency IMM cells, if space qualified, would be state-of-the-art and keep the US ahead in the competitive race for space power generation.\rAs the trade space between mass, power, and volume widens many immediate benefits are realized. Missions requiring higher power such as solar electric propulsion will be enabled. Flexible cells allow for rolled stowage options, which can grant an immediate payload weight savings. Lower mass cells may allow for a dual or step down launch vehicle, which can grant millions of dollars in savings.\rThe customers supported by this program ( primarily NASA, SMC, and OGA) are all represented on the joint government team. Collaboration on the government side is key in developing a marketable, cost effective solar cell product that also meets DoD mission requirements. Expected MRL 5 at program completion.",

In particular, this effort seeks to develop techniques for rapidly developing capabilities in new languages and domains of military interest despite limited amounts of labeled, transcribed, and\/or translated training data.  The technical objectives are (1) develop automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), natural language processing (NLP), and speech processing (SP) algorithms that are adaptable for evolving contexts; (2) develop ASR, MT, NLP, and SP algorithms that are robust for items and events not seen in training data, especially out-of-vocabulary words; and (3) understand the end-to-end effects of various ASR, MT, NLP, and SP algorithms on performance.  Key technical challenges are:  1) investigation of methods for morphological analysis (i.e., the process of segmenting word tokens into prefixes, stems, and suffixes) for several foreign languages for use in ASR, MT, and NLP to help address the out-of-vocabulary problem due to language complexity, and 2) domain and context adaptation of systems and detecting and robustly handling named entities (i.e., names of people, places, organizations, etc.) and other essential elements of information in ASR, MT, and NLP.  These various human language technologies will be integrated and then demonstrated in military environments.  Major applications are 1) multilingual multimedia information extraction and retrieval (for being able to find and extract information from speech, videos, and text to support threat warning) and 2) speech-to-speech translation (for being able to carry on a conversation with someone who speaks a foreign language).  Customers include NASIC and INTEL Community through NASIC\/GXKT\u00d5s Integrated Discovery, Exploitation, and Analysis Services (IDEAS).  Post program TRL objective is 6.",

A deployed F-22 synthetic coolant has no occupational exposure limit, this due to an assumption that inhalation exposure was unlikely, and is now proven untrue.  New engine oils have not been analyzed for toxicity; in fact, no engine oil toxicity study has been conducted for over 10 years, even though the engine oils used by the Air Force are military specific and not used by common air industry.  Currently a new additive is being proposed for the +100 additive package that alters jet fuel to make JP-8.  However, the +100 package has not been tested, though it is stored and handled separately from JP-8, until the mixture is metered into the fuel truck or aircraft fuel tank.  These examples show a significant gap in safe use knowledge of novel chemical systems in the AF.  The need for toxicity analysis of all fielded chemical systems especially the mentioned high-volume use in the AF requires immediate attention. This research program and the FY 15 POM initiative will provide funding for chemical toxicity and deleterious response biomarker data for multiple AF aircraft operations. New fluids and diverse mixture exposures occurring on present high performance aircraft and projected chemicals and materials of future platforms will be assessed to ensure where airman protection should occur for optimal performance. The initiative will be directed to create the experimental capabilities to predict toxicity in real-world flight situations and determine the impact of combined stress factors (e.g. dynamic toxicity exposure profiles) have on physiological performance and associated biomarkers.  These data will be computationally coalesced with physiological stressors to provide the key exposure biomarkers for sensing as predictors of ensuing cognitive degradation.",

The program emphasizes three key research thrusts for developing performance augmentation solutions:   neuro-stimulation, physical training for CPO, and biofeedback.  The technical challenges are to identify those physical, biological, and behavioral attributes that overlay biological and sensory resources that can be tapped to improve an individual's cognitive capability.

The lack of automation increases pilot burden and slows target prosecution due to the steps required to slew the sensor onto a requested coordinate. The result is suboptimal allocation of tactical sensors that have the opportunity to provide value to more than a single user at time.\rThe AFRL\/RISA Tactical Information Management group has been a leading innovator in in-mission information dissemination over tactical networks, advancing the state of the art from inefficient video broadcast (e.g., ROVER) to information products tailored to consumer predicates and resource availability. In a similar manner, ISTAC is using the AFRL\/RI core competencies of information management, connectivity, and advanced computing to expand the near-real-time utility of tactical airborne sensors from traditional stove-piped, single operator control to shared access by multiple third party users in a disadvantaged network.

	"general_description_long": "Research on cognitive modeling has advanced to providing precise characterizations of human performance in a variety of tasks and in many domains. While these scientific achievements are impressive, they are also nearly always conducted in the context of small-scale laboratory task environments.  AF operations occur in complex, dynamic environments.  Current cognitive modeling tools and standard approaches to model development and validation are inadequate to meet the challenges that will be faced in developing models to interact in such domains. This research is focused on developing technologies and solutions to allow cognitive models to scale to real-world contexts in a cost-effective manner. This includes a combination of new modeling formalisms to increase the level which cognitive models can be specified, high performance computing resources to enable the real-time execution and validation, and complex model development to address issues related to the interaction of cognitive abilities as they are brought to bear in real world contexts.\r\rThe FY15 POM Initiative includes this program. The initiative provides; Standards for sharable scenario content, data, and metrics, interoperable software architecture, protocols and methods to develop, deliver, manage and evaluate training content within and across LVC environments. System of system based architectures to evaluate application of game-based technologies, methods, use cases, and standards for training scenario development. Software to increase the speed and realism of developing computer-generated cognitive models using real world data. Software to develop improved computer-generated actors to increase the efficiency and fidelity of training in LVC contexts. Validated links between operations performance and readiness integrated in USAF tracking systems: protocols, software, and databases to track performance data over time to predict when warfighters need training to alleviate predicted loss of proficiency.",

AFRL\/RV has been developing 33-35% high efficiency solar cells under an ATD for the last several years. Now that several thousand prototype cells have been built and tested under development programs it is time to transition from R&D to production. AFRL ManTech involvement at the early stages of this transition will greatly reduce the manufacturing and cost risks. \rThe objective of this program is to improve manufacturing capabilities, develop improved manufacturing processes, and space qualify AM0, one-sun, inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cells. Productization and qualification of high efficiency, flexible IMM space solar cells will improve critical performance and volume budgets for warfighter-specific satellite payloads.  AF ManTech is supporting the space industrial base by enabling the cost effective, domestic production of space solar cells, which are on the Critical Technologies List. High efficiency IMM cells, if space qualified, would be state-of-the-art and keep the US ahead in the competitive race for space power generation.\rAs the trade space between mass, power, and volume widens many immediate benefits are realized. Missions requiring higher power such as solar electric propulsion will be enabled. Flexible cells allow for rolled stowage options, which can grant an immediate payload weight savings. Lower mass cells may allow for a dual or step down launch vehicle, which can grant millions of dollars in savings.\rThe customers supported by this program ( primarily NASA, SMC, and OGA) are all represented on the joint government team. Collaboration on the government side is key in developing a marketable, cost effective solar cell product that also meets DoD mission requirements. Expected MRL 5 at program completion.",

It grew out of a successful in-house 6.1 research effort that determined that the new field of cold atoms physics provided the necessary technology to contribute significantly to the development of ultra-accurate inertial navigation.  In 2012, this inertial navigation research was combined with R&D to determine the best path forward for the next generation space-borne atomic clocks required by the Space and Missile Center Global Positioning System Program Office (SMC\/GPS SPO).  The current research is focused on understanding, designing and characterizing precisely generated magnetic fields to enhance the sensitivity of confined devices. Funding through Section 219 funds has expanded this effort to investigate the operation of multiple atom sensors on a single microchip. Operating multiple devices on a single atom chip has the potential to drastically reduce the SWAP of cold atom devices while maintaining overall accuracy. Longer term, the effort is exploring the physics needed to develop autonomous Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and fit them on space craft, as described in sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3. This effort is longer term than the current Ballistic Missile Technology Inertial Navigation development, and could also contribute long term to the Inertial Sensor program",

The desired output of characterization in three dimensions includes digital representation of the structure\/damage of interest with appropriate statistical metrics of precision, accuracy, and quantified uncertainty of the representation. Characterization includes developing probabilistic methods to convert received information from destructive and\/or nondestructive measurements into digital representations and information. Development of signal\/image\/data analysis methods plus identifying and exploiting optimal statistical measures of the quality of inversion is included.  This advances the current state-of-the-art from nondestructive estimation of size and destructive representation of statistical parameters and addresses the technical challenges of stochastic variability, complexity, and boundaries conditions found on USAF systems.

It will validate tailored material properties and enable new process controls independent of statistical sampling.  This capability will reduce the cost\/time of interval-based maintenance, increasing aircraft availability.  In addition, it reduces scrap from processing while enabling extreme performance materials through tailored microstructure.

Aerial layer networking that can support joint operations with bigger pipes over radios with reasonable levels of flexibility are required.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has invested $11M to study how Joint Aerial Layer Networking (JALN) can be achieved.  The Aerial Layer Communication program is focused on bringing a more effective Aerial Layer Network to a mission, making the network act as a force multiplier. The Aerial Layer Communication program supports the JALN concept. The characteristics of today\u00d5s networks could be described as 1. Platform and Link Centric, 2. Self Contained, and 3. Pre-Planned.  The Aerial Layer Communication program seeks to develop a more effective network morphing each of these characteristics to, 1. Network-of-Networks Centric, 2. Open, and 3. Flexible and Ad-Hoc, respectively.  The Aerial Layer Communication program is focused on developing network connectivity and security aspects of the network with these more effective characteristics as well as proof of concept (V&V). A large portion of the effort will be slanted towards Network Enabled Strike Technology (Network Enabled and Software Defined Information\/RF Links, and their Network, Dynamic Routers, Encryption Device(s), and Network Managers as well as emerging Software Defined Networking.  The Technical nuggets that the Aerial Layer communication program seeks to address and align with AFRL\u00d5s Connectively and Dissemination Core Technical Competency (CTC) are; 1. Secure reconfigurable protocol for self-healing airborne routing, 2. Joint network situational awareness for integrated NetOps, 3.

New materials are currently being developed by RX research teams.  This effort will also develop and mature novel structural materials that provide lower cost and\/or lower weight penalty over conventional approaches.  The objectives in this area are: 1) quantify improvement to performance over conventional hardened material approaches, 2) demonstrate hardening approaches versus projected threat capability and 3) determine applications for implementation.\rOne final area of research is to evaluate and mature sensor hardening techniques that have been successfully applied in aircraft sensor applications to munitions.  The requirements for hardening may be different in these applications, so hardening solutions needs to be tailored for these particular cases.",

The 3 prime engine manufacturers, government & suppliers collaboratively develop & execute technical program plans aimed at integration to reduce engine cost\/manufacturing cycle time & improve engine performance in 7 technical areas:  CMCs, OMCs, ceramic hybrid bearings, machining, castings, small hole drilling & additive manufacturing.  The portfolio of over 40 projects is funded by AF Core ManTech, AF and Navy SBIRs, DMS&T, IBIF & ARRA funds (over a $80M investment to date).  AMPI\u00d5s period of performance is 2006 \u00d0 2017, and the team consists of over 50 organizations.  The objective of the Ceramics Affordability program is to improve the affordability & manufacturability of CMCs for hot sections of advanced turbine engines with expected temperatures of up to 2700\u00a1F. The use of these materials will allow a reduction in weight\/specific fuel consumption in future engines.  This effort will identify & support projects in the supply chain that will enable engine manufacturers to affordably meet the temperature & durability goals. Additionally, Ceramics Affordability may play a role in addressing domestic fiber production & higher temperature fiber production.  The program is planned to be executed from 2014-2018 with an AF ManTech Core budget of approximately $10M.  Both programs help to mature & transition basic materials research within AFRL and will also have a significant impact on upcoming AETD and HEETE demonstrators.

Demonstration will be by building and characterizing IRFPAs using existing, well characterized ROICs.  The largest program risk is the detector area required at the necessary composition for 130K operation.  In order to demonstrate a single chip, 38 cm2 processed detector array, ~ 52 cm2 of material must be grown by epitaxial means.  Growth control is needed to obtain thickness non-uniformity <2%, composition non-uniformity <0.004x, and doping non-uniformity <10%.  Processing procedures must be developed and controls validated for material screening (pre and post growth), handling (including cleaning), delineation, etching, metallization, and bump bond formation.  Also needed are processes and procedures for hybridization, post hybridization processing that includes reducing total thickness variations, polishing, A\/R coating, packaging and test.  Phase II will focus on technology development to produce large format (at least 38 square centimeters), high resolution (9 Megapixels), low noise, MWIR focal plane arrays for strategic space missile warning applications.  Read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) will be developed to be radiation hardened to 100KRad (Si) by design, and intrinsically optically hardened to prevent denied access via blooming, row or column outages, or ROIC failure.

This effort shall refine HVM PII requirements for improved tools, and prototype these tools.  These tools shall include the ability to remotely apply an NDI damage verification technique through a limited access holes (similar to the access for the initial visual inspection using a borescope).    For example, C-130 floor board fasteners are removed and a borescope is passed through the fastener hole to examine structure below floor level.   The HVM PII tool would be used to verify the borescope visual findings and ensure inspection coverage.   Due to the minimalistic and remote approach to this aircraft assessment, the tool shall provide elementary NDI capability that can confirm visual crack findings using non-NDI skilled\/certified operators.  The primary challenge is the limited access and probe.  This tool will be applied in hangar and flight-line settings (deployed PII team) as a mobile, universal inspection device.  The opportunity to initially impact C-130 HVM inspections could expand to multiple aircraft systems as the HVM practice matures.\rAdvance TRL from 5 to 6.",

We've supported several SBIR and critical SBIR projects that have transitioned to a first tier OEM.  One current example of one of our automation efforts is the Automated Fastener Installation System (AFIS) which automates the preparation, cleaning and kitting of various fasteners for the F-35.  This effort is scheduled to transition in late 2014.  \rMilitary aircraft have tight tolerances on part to part variability including inter-component steps and gaps.  We've leveraged SBIR funds to sponsor several projects that improve the ability to quickly assess and compensate for part to part variability.  One current project we're supporting will allow the manufacturer to quickly determine whether components meet geometric tolerances without the use of touch probes on CMM's.  Future efforts could include modeling efforts for the prediction of composite spring-in\/spring-back to reduce manufacturing integration and tooling costs.\rThere is a need for higher temperature composite materials and manufacturing processes for turbine engine structural components, hot wash and hypersonic structures.  We recently initiated an effort to mature high temperature composites and their manufacturing processes.  The initial focus will be structural components for turbine engines with follow up projects for hot wash structures.\rIntegration of electronics into composite structures would enable large area arrays and multiple sensors with no increase in system drag.   We are collaborating with AFRL\/RQVS to develop manufacturing methods  for integrated antenna structures in composites.",

The HIT programs focus on a wide variety of technologies that are critical to the development of highly-capable and efficient turbine engines.  Areas of research include fan\/inlet interaction, compressors, combustion, afterburners, advanced optical diagnostics, turbines, structural dynamics, novel propulsion systems, mechanical systems, lubricants, bearings, nanoenergetics, and alternative and endothermic fuels.  The R&D laboratories used to carry out this research are exceptional and in many cases they are national resources.  A few of these facilities include the Compressor Research Facility (CRF), the High Pressure Combustor Research Facility (HPCRF), the Turbine Research Facility (TRF), the Combustion and Laser Diagnostics Research Complex (CLDRD) and the Detonation Engine Research Facility (DERF).  The HIT program is a rolling four-year program that is formally reviewed by the AFRL\/RQT Corporate Board biennially.  The product of the biennial HIT review is the RQT In-House R&D Master Plan which includes technical direction and budgetary details.

These threats include the direct & indirect effects of lightning strikes, High-altitude EM Pulse (HEMP), and High Power Microwaves (HPM).\rTraditional weapon platforms were constructed primarily aluminum and titanium, which provided a reasonable measure of shielding effectiveness. Modern systems such as lightweight UAVs, precision guided munitions (PGMs), aircraft (A\/C) and satellites are primarily constructed of carbon fiber composite materials which are only 0.3% as conductive as their metal counterparts. Additionally, structurally integrated apertures for both RF and optical RX\/TX devices provide openings which can allow front door coupling into mission critical systems.  In a recent study it was determined that many of these weapon systems were susceptible to HPM system threats. This has generated a significant need for materials development and maturation of materials that can be structurally integrated into these modern composite systems. These materials needs in the near term require structurally integrated enhanced hardening for main body and enclosure components and agile, and in the mid and far term threat responsive materials for structural integration into apertures.\rAdvance TRL from 4 to 6 - Materials scale up program supported by Title III activity and F-35 PEO sponsored critical SBIR activities to bring technology up to scale.

More detailed questions are documented in the DSC Mission Area Review, but in short, include:\r1. How can we quantify the attribute of resilience, as it applies to space systems, architectures and space missions?  \r2. What threats or hazards can and should be protected against, and how does that potentially vary by specific satellite mission and\/or orbit?\r3. What current hardening options do we currently have, and what is the cost\/benefit associated with those options?  This should apply to all segments of a space system (space, link and ground), with the exception of physical ground site hardening with is beyond the scope).\r4. What far-term technologies, or other technologies not previously considered for resilience, might contribute to a more resilient spacecraft?  This should include potential recovery technologies.\r5. What do the space-cyber threats of the future look like, and what can be done to protect against and\/or recover from them?\r6. Can science and\/or technology enable smarter architectural strategies, through alternate CONOPS, or modified TTP? \rThe main purpose of the SRT program is to answer these questions and identify via technology options and concepts for increased space resilience.",

Show that these techniques can be used to find targets, including those that employ CC&D, over vast swaths of adversary territory.  Achieving this goal requires improvements in spectrometer noise performance (which includes both optical and focal plane array advancements); understanding, compensating for, and exploiting off-nadir imaging phenomenology; and achieving automated material detection and identification with clutter limited false alarm rates.  Advances in algorithms for hard target detection and identification are required at nadir and will be applied to extended ranges.  In addition to in-house algorithms, sensor characterization, and field test work, the HSI research portfolio includes partnering with national laboratories on state-of-the-art spectrometer designs, AF and other DoD and IC entities on focal plane array technology, and international partners on phenomenology studies.

This program supports innovative basic research on the fundamental principles and methodologies needed to enable intelligent machine behavior in support of autonomous and mixed-initiative (i.e., human-agent teaming) systems. The overall vision of this program is that future computational systems will achieve high levels of performance, adaptation, flexibility, self-repair, and other forms of intelligent behavior in the complex, uncertain, adversarial, and highly dynamic environments faced by the U.S. Air Force. This program covers the full spectrum of computational and machine intelligence, from cognitively plausible reasoning processes that are responsible for human performance in complex problem-solving and decision-making tasks, to non-cognitive computational models of intelligence necessary to create robust intelligent autonomous systems. In the midst of this spectrum are the technologies needed to seamlessly incorporate intelligent computational systems into mixed human-agent teams. The program is divided into three sub-areas that span the full spectrum of computational and machine intelligence. They are: Computational Cognition, Robust Decision Making and Machine Intelligence.

However, new theoretical and empirical guidance is needed to prescribe maximally effective mixtures of human and machine decision making in environments that are becoming increasingly complex and demanding as a result of the high uncertainty, complexity, time urgency, and rapidly changing nature of military missions. Massive amounts of relevant data are now available from powerful sensing systems to inform these decisions; however, the task of quickly extracting knowledge to guide human actions from an overwhelming flow of information is daunting. Basic research is needed to produce cognitive systems that are capable of communicating with humans in a natural manner that builds trust, are proficient at condensing intensive streams of sensory data into useful conceptual information in an efficient, real-time manner, and are competent at making rapid, adaptive, and robust prescriptions for prediction, inference, decision, and planning. New computational and mathematical principles of cognition are needed to form a symbiosis between human and machine systems, which coordinates and allocates responsibility between these entities in an optimal collaborative manner, achieving comprehensive situation awareness and anticipatory command and control.

In 2012, this inertial navigation research was combined with R&D to determine the best path forward for the next generation space-borne atomic clocks required by the Space and Missile Center Global Positioning System Program Office (SMC\/GPS SPO).  The current research is focused on understanding, designing and characterizing precisely generated magnetic fields to enhance the sensitivity of confined devices. Funding through Section 219 funds has expanded this effort to investigate the operation of multiple atom sensors on a single microchip. Operating multiple devices on a single atom chip has the potential to drastically reduce the SWAP of cold atom devices while maintaining overall accuracy. Longer term, the effort is exploring the physics needed to develop autonomous Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and fit them on space craft, as described in sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3. This effort is longer term than the current Ballistic Missile Technology Inertial Navigation development, and could also contribute long term to the Inertial Sensor program",

The program will secondarily impact the development of eye-safe lasers for additional Air Force needs (e.g., laser weapons and laser radar).  The scope includes the development of material synthesis, processing, and growth techniques for fabricating (1) laser components such as laser amplifiers for generating fixed-wavelength laser light and (2) nonlinear optical components such as optical parametric oscillators and amplifiers for shifting the laser wavelength to the mid-infrared bands where infrared-seekers operate for damage\/disrupt processes with the seeker guidance systems. The scope also involves materials characterization to understand the materials\u00d5 physics that limits performance and to provide material parameters to the laser designer.",
